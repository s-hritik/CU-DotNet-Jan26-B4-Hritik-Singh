Problem Statement: The Mutual Friends Network

You are tasked with analyzing a C# implementation of a simple social networking system that manages member relationships. Review the provided Person, SocialNetwork, and Program classes and address the following requirements:

 
1. Logic Trace

Based on the execution of the Main method, determine the exact console output of network.ShowNetwork().

Pay specific attention to the AddFriend method:

• How does the method handle the reciprocal nature of friendships (if A is friends with B, is B automatically friends with A)?
• What prevents a user from being added to the same friend list multiple times?
 
2. Code Analysis & Optimization

Identify and provide solutions for the following architectural points:

• Encapsulation: The Friends list in the Person class is currently public. Explain why this violates OOP principles and how you would restrict access while still allowing the SocialNetwork to display data.
• Efficiency: Rewrite the nested foreach loop inside the ShowNetwork method using LINQ to make the string construction more concise.
• Edge Cases: What would happen if aman.AddFriend(aman) was called? Propose a validation check to handle this scenario.
It is a direct implementation of an Undirected Graph data structure
