Problem Statement: ASP.NET Core MVC – Training Portal
You have been assigned the task of developing a basic web application using ASP.NET Core MVC for a college training program. The purpose of this application is to help new learners understand the fundamental building blocks of the MVC architecture, namely Controllers, Action Methods, Views, and Navigation.

Business Scenario
A college wants a simple Training Portal to display information related to its training offerings. The portal should allow users to navigate between different sections such as Home, Courses, and Contact using menu links. Each section must be handled following proper MVC conventions.

Functional Requirements
- Create an ASP.NET Core MVC application named 'TrainingPortal'.

- Implement a controller to manage training-related pages.

- Create action methods for Home, Courses, and Contact pages.

- Design separate views for each action method.

- Configure navigation links to move between pages without using hard-coded URLs.

- Ensure proper routing so that URLs map correctly to controller actions.

Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, learners should be able to:
- Understand the role of controllers and action methods
- Create and organize views based on MVC conventions
- Use Tag Helpers for navigation
- Trace the request flow from browser to controller to view

Expected Outcome
At the end of this exercise, the Training Portal should open on a Home page and allow smooth navigation to Courses and Contact pages using the application menu.
