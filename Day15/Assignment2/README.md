Order Processing Domain – Non-Static Class Design
 
Objective
Design and implement a concrete class that demonstrates correct usage of non-static members, including:
• Instance fields
• Instance properties
• Instance methods
• Non-static constructors
All logic must rely on object creation and instance interaction.
 
Application Type
• .NET Console Application
• Language: C#
• Target Framework: .NET 6 / .NET 8
 
Class to Be Designed
Class Name (Mandatory)
Order
 
Mandatory Design Requirements
1. Constructors (Non-Static Only)
The class must contain exactly two constructors:
1. Default constructor
o Initializes order date to current date
o Initializes order status to "NEW"
2. Parameterized constructor
o Accepts:
▪ int orderId
▪ string customerName
o Initializes mandatory fields
Static constructors are not allowed.
 
2. Instance Fields (Encapsulation Required)
The class must contain at least 3 private, non-static fields, including:
Field
Purpose
_orderId
Stores order identifier
_customerName
Stores customer name
_totalAmount
Stores order total
 
3. Instance Properties
Create the following non-static properties:
1. OrderId
o Read-only property
2. CustomerName
o Read/write property
o Rejects null or empty values
3. TotalAmount
o Read-only property
o Value updated internally only
 
4. Instance Methods (Non-Static)
Implement at least 3 instance methods:
Method
Description
AddItem(decimal price)
Adds item price to total
ApplyDiscount(decimal percentage)
Applies discount if percentage is between 1–30
GetOrderSummary()
Returns formatted order summary
 
5. Validation Rules
• Total amount cannot be negative
• Customer name must be valid
• Discount must be applied only once per order
• All validations must be enforced via instance logic
 
Usage Requirement (Mandatory)
In Main():
1. Create multiple objects of Order
2. Use both constructors
3. Call all instance methods
4. Display results using returned values
 
Sample Usage (Expected)
Order order = new Order(101, "Rahul");
order.AddItem(500);
order.AddItem(300);
order.ApplyDiscount(10);
 
Console.WriteLine(order.GetOrderSummary());
 
Sample Output
Order Id: 101
Customer: Rahul
Total Amount: 720
Status: NEW
