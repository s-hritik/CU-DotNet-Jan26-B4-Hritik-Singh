Problem Statement
Utility Billing System – Tariff Calculation Engine
Business Context
A city corporation wants to build a Utility Billing System that can calculate monthly bills for different types of utility connections.
Each utility follows common billing rules, but the calculation logic differs based on the utility type.
The system must be extensible, so new utility types can be added in the future without modifying existing billing logic.
 
Design Requirements
1. Abstract Base Class
Create an abstract class named:
UtilityBill
This class represents the common structure for all utility bills.
 
2. Common Properties (Concrete)
The abstract class must contain the following properties:
• ConsumerId (int)
• ConsumerName (string)
• UnitsConsumed (decimal)
• RatePerUnit (decimal)
 
3. Abstract Method (Must Be Overridden)
Declare an abstract method in UtilityBill:
public abstract decimal CalculateBillAmount();
➡️ Each utility type must implement its own billing calculation logic.
 
4. Virtual Method (Optional Override)
Define a virtual method in the abstract class:
public virtual decimal CalculateTax(decimal billAmount)
Default behavior:
• Apply 5% tax on the bill amount.
Derived classes may override this method if they follow a different tax rule.
 
5. Concrete Method (Non-Overridable by Default)
Add a concrete method:
public void PrintBill()
This method should:
• Display consumer details
• Display total units
• Display final payable amount (including tax)
➡️ This method must internally call:
• CalculateBillAmount()
• CalculateTax()
 
Derived Classes
1. ElectricityBill
Inherits from UtilityBill
Rules:
• Rate per unit is passed during object creation
• If UnitsConsumed > 300, apply 10% surcharge on the bill amount
• Override:
o CalculateBillAmount()
• Use default tax logic (do not override CalculateTax())
 
2. WaterBill
Inherits from UtilityBill
Rules:
• Flat rate per unit
• No surcharge
• Override:
o CalculateBillAmount()
o CalculateTax() → apply 2% tax only
 
3. GasBill
Inherits from UtilityBill
Rules:
• Monthly fixed charge of ₹150 added to bill amount
• Override:
o CalculateBillAmount()
• Tax remains zero (override tax method to return 0)
 
Application Requirements
Create a Console Application that:
1. Creates objects of ElectricityBill, WaterBill, and GasBill
2. Stores them in a collection of type:
List<UtilityBill>
3. Iterates through the collection and calls:
PrintBill();
➡️ Demonstrate runtime polymorphism through method overriding.
