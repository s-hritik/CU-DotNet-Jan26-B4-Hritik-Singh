Sales Order Processing System (Methods-Focused)
 
Problem Statement
A retail company wants a console-based Sales Order Processing System developed in .NET.
The objective is to design and use methods correctly to process weekly sales data, calculate totals, apply discounts, and generate a sales summary.
The emphasis is not UI, but method design, usage, and maintenance-friendly structure.
 
Business Scenario
• The company records daily sales amounts for 7 days
• Discounts depend on total weekly sales
• Tax must be applied after discount
• All calculations must be done using well-defined methods
 
Functional Requirements
1. Sales Data Input
• Accept 7 daily sales values
• Store them in a decimal[]
• Input validation must be done via a separate method
Method to design:
static void ReadWeeklySales(decimal[] sales)
Responsibilities:
• Read input
• Validate non-negative values
• Store in array
 
2. Total and Average Calculation
Calculate:
• Total weekly sales
• Average daily sales
Methods to design:
static decimal CalculateTotal(decimal[] sales)
static decimal CalculateAverage(decimal total, int days)
 
3. Highest and Lowest Sales Day
Determine:
• Highest sale value and day number
• Lowest sale value and day number
Methods to design (must use out parameters):
static decimal FindHighestSale(decimal[] sales, out int day)
static decimal FindLowestSale(decimal[] sales, out int day)
 
4. Discount Calculation (Method Overloading)
Discount rules:
• If total ≥ 50,000 → 10% discount
• Otherwise → 5% discount
 
 
Method Overloading Requirement:
static decimal CalculateDiscount(decimal total)
static decimal CalculateDiscount(decimal total, bool isFestivalWeek)
Festival week rule:
• Extra 5% discount if isFestivalWeek == true
 
5. Tax Calculation
• Apply 18% tax on the discounted amount
Method to design:
static decimal CalculateTax(decimal amount)
 
6. Final Payable Amount
Calculate final amount using:
• Total sales
• Discount
• Tax
Method to design:
static decimal CalculateFinalAmount(decimal total, decimal discount, decimal tax)
 
7. Sales Categorization (Parallel Array)
Categorize each day’s sale:
• "Low" → < 5,000
• "Medium" → 5,000–15,000
• "High" → > 15,000
Method to design:
static void GenerateSalesCategory(decimal[] sales, string[] categories)
 
Output Requirements
Display a clean report:
Weekly Sales Summary
--------------------
Total Sales        : 78,500.00
Average Daily Sale : 11,214.29
 
Highest Sale       : 18,000.00 (Day 6)
Lowest Sale        : 3,200.00  (Day 2)
 
Discount Applied   : 7,850.00
Tax Amount         : 12,168.30
Final Payable      : 82,818.30
 
Day-wise Category:
Day 1 : Medium
Day 2 : Low
...
Day 7 : High
 
 
 
Technical Constraints (Strict)
Learners must:
• Use methods for every logical operation
• Use arrays only (no List<T>, no LINQ)
• Use:
o ref / out where appropriate
o Method overloading
o Meaningful method names
• Avoid:
o Writing all logic in Main
o Duplicate logic
o Hard-coded values inside Main
 
Learning Objectives (What This Tests)
This single exercise validates:
• Method definition vs invocation
• Parameter vs argument understanding
• Return types vs void
• out parameters
• Method overloading
• Separation of concerns
• Maintainable, readable code structure
