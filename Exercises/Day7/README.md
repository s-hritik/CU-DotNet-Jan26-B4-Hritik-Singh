Case Study: Smart Access Control Log Processor
Business Scenario
A secure facility records entry logs in a compact, single-line format to minimize storage.
Each access attempt is logged as one line of input in the following format:
<GateCode>|<UserInitial>|<AccessLevel>|<IsActive>|<Attempts>
Example Input
A3|S|5|true|120
 
Field Meaning & Data Types
Field
Description
Expected Type
GateCode
Gate identifier (single character + digit)
string
UserInitial
First letter of user name
char
AccessLevel
Security level (0–9)
byte
IsActive
Whether the user account is active
bool
Attempts
Number of access attempts today
byte
 
Functional Requirements
1. Input Handling (Mandatory)
• Read all values using a single Console.ReadLine()
• Split and parse values correctly
• Do not prompt separately for each value
 
2. Validation Rules (Tough Part)
Your program must validate the following:
1. GateCode
o Must be exactly 2 characters
o First character must be a letter
o Second character must be a digit
2. UserInitial
o Must be a single uppercase letter
o Use char APIs (not regex)
3. AccessLevel
o Must be between 1 and 7
o Stored as byte
4. IsActive
o Must accept only true or false (case-insensitive)
5. Attempts
o Must be ≤ 200
o Stored as byte
If any validation fails, print:
INVALID ACCESS LOG
and exit.
 
3. Business Logic
If validation succeeds:
• If IsActive == false
• ACCESS DENIED – INACTIVE USER
• Else if Attempts > 100
• ACCESS DENIED – TOO MANY ATTEMPTS
• Else if AccessLevel >= 5
• ACCESS GRANTED – HIGH SECURITY
• Else
• ACCESS GRANTED – STANDARD
 
4. Output Formatting (Mandatory)
On success, display output exactly in this format:
Gate      : A3
User      : S
Level     : 5
Attempts  : 120
Status    : ACCESS DENIED – TOO MANY ATTEMPTS
Alignment must be clean, using formatting or padding.
 
Constraints (Important for Assessment)
• ❌ No regex
• ❌ No exception swallowing
• ❌ No multiple ReadLine calls
• ✔ Must use byte, char, and bool
• ✔ Must use string formatting (PadRight, alignment, or interpolation)
 
Sample Test Cases
Input
B7|R|6|true|45
Output
ACCESS GRANTED – HIGH SECURITY
 
Input
C1|m|3|true|10
Output
INVALID ACCESS LOG
(Reason: lowercase char)
 
Input
A9|K|2|false|20
Output
ACCESS DENIED – INACTIVE USER
