Problem Statement
Bank Transaction Narration Analyzer (Console Application)
Background
In banking systems, transaction narrations are often entered manually or generated by different subsystems.
As a result, these narrations may contain extra spaces, inconsistent casing, and varying wording, even for the same type of transaction.
To ensure consistency and enable basic analysis, you are required to process and analyze a transaction narration using core .NET string operations only.
 
Objective
Develop a .NET Console Application that reads a single transaction record, normalizes the narration, searches for key transaction terms, compares it with a standard narration, and displays a formatted summary.
 
Input Format
The application must read one line of input in the following pattern:
<TransactionId>#<AccountHolderName>#<TransactionNarration>
Example Input
TX901#Ramesh Kumar#   CASH   deposit   successful  
 
Functional Requirements
1. Narration Normalization
The TransactionNarration must be normalized using basic string operations:
• Remove leading and trailing spaces
• Replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space
• Convert the entire narration to lowercase
 
2. Keyword Identification
After normalization, check whether the narration contains any of the following keywords:
deposit
withdrawal
transfer
 
3. Narration Comparison
The system defines the following standard transaction narration:
cash deposit successful
Compare the normalized narration with the standard narration to determine whether it matches exactly.
 
4. Categorization Rules
Based on the analysis, classify the transaction as follows:
• If no keyword is found
• NON-FINANCIAL TRANSACTION
• If a keyword is found and the narration matches the standard narration
• STANDARD TRANSACTION
• If a keyword is found but the narration does not match the standard narration
• CUSTOM TRANSACTION
 
Output Requirements
Display the result in the following formatted and aligned manner:
Transaction ID : TX901
Account Holder : Ramesh Kumar
Narration      : cash deposit successful
Category       : STANDARD TRANSACTION
 
Constraints
• Only one Console.ReadLine() is allowed
• Do not use:
o Culture or globalization APIs
o Regular expressions
• Use only basic string methods such as:
o Trim
o Replace
o Contains or IndexOf
o Equals
• Output formatting is mandatory
 
Learning Outcomes
By completing this exercise, the learner will demonstrate the ability to:
• Perform string cleanup and normalization
• Search within strings using built-in APIs
• Compare strings accurately
• Produce well-formatted console output
• Apply string logic in an accounts/finance domain scenario
