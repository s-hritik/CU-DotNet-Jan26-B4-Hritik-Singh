Case Study: Shared Greeting Library
Business Scenario
A company is building multiple small console tools.
To avoid repeating code, they want a shared library that generates greeting messages, which can be reused by different applications.
Your task is to:
1. Create a Class Library (.NET Framework)
2. Add a simple method in the library
3. Reference the library from a Console Application
4. Use the library method to display output
 
Solution Structure (Mandatory)
Create a .NET Framework solution with the following projects:
GreetingSolution
│
├── GreetingLibrary   (Class Library – .NET Framework)
└── GreetingApp       (Console App – .NET Framework)
 
Project 1: Class Library – GreetingLibrary
Step 1: Create the Library Project
• Project Type: Class Library (.NET Framework)
• Project Name: GreetingLibrary
 
Step 2: Create a Class
Create a class named:
GreetingHelper
 
Step 3: Add a Method
Add the following method to the class:
public static string GetGreeting(string name)
Method Rules
• If name is empty or null → return "Hello, Guest!"
• Otherwise → return "Hello, <name>!"
Examples:
Hello, Sharad!
Hello, Guest!
 
Project 2: Console App – GreetingApp
Step 1: Create Console Application
• Project Type: Console App (.NET Framework)
• Project Name: GreetingApp
 
Step 2: Add Reference to Library
• Right-click GreetingApp
• Add Project Reference
• Select GreetingLibrary
 
 
Step 3: Use the Library
In Main():
1. Ask the user to enter their name
2. Call GreetingHelper.GetGreeting()
3. Display the returned greeting
