Problem Statement: Weekly Sales Analysis System
Background
A retail outlet records daily sales figures for a week (7 days). Management requires a small .NET console-based utility to analyze weekly performance using arrays only, without relying on advanced collections or LINQ.
 
Objective
Develop a Weekly Sales Analysis System in .NET that stores, processes, and reports sales data for 7 consecutive days using array-based logic.
 
Functional Requirements
1. Data Capture
• Use a single-dimensional decimal[] array of size 7 to store daily sales.
• Accept user input for each day (Day 1 to Day 7).
• Validate input:
o Sales value must be greater than or equal to zero
o Invalid input should prompt re-entry for the same day.
 
2. Weekly Sales Analysis
Using array traversal logic, implement the following:
1. Total Weekly Sales
o Calculate the sum of all sales values.
2. Average Daily Sales
o Compute the average using array.Length.
3. Highest Sales Day
o Identify:
▪ Highest sales amount
▪ Corresponding day number (1–7)
4. Lowest Sales Day
o Identify:
▪ Lowest sales amount
▪ Corresponding day number (1–7)
5. Days Above Average
o Count how many days recorded sales greater than the weekly average.
 
3. Sales Categorization (Parallel Array)
• Create a second array (string[]) to store sales category for each day:
o "Low" → Sales < 5,000
o "Medium" → Sales between 5,000 and 15,000
o "High" → Sales > 15,000
• The category array must maintain index alignment with the sales array.
 
4. Output Report
Display a formatted weekly report similar to:
Weekly Sales Report
-------------------
Total Sales        : 82,500.00
Average Daily Sale : 11,785.71
 
Highest Sale       : 18,200.00 (Day 6)
Lowest Sale        : 3,400.00  (Day 2)
 
Days Above Average : 3
Also display a day-wise sales category summary:
Day 1 : Medium
Day 2 : Low
Day 3 : High
...
Day 7 : Medium
 
Technical Constraints
• Use arrays only
• Do NOT use:
o List<T>
o LINQ
o Array.Sort() for finding min/max
• Use:
o for loops for processing
o foreach loops only for display (optional)
• Follow clean coding practices and meaningful variable names
 
Learning Outcomes
After completing this exercise, learners should be able to:
• Apply array indexing effectively
• Use parallel arrays
• Perform manual aggregation and comparison logic
• Translate real-world requirements into array-based solutions
