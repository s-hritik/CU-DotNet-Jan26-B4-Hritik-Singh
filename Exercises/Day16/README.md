Application Configuration Tracker Using Static Members
 
Problem Statement
You are required to design a utility class named ApplicationConfig that manages application-level configuration and usage statistics using static members only.
This class should not be instantiated and must rely entirely on static properties, static methods, and a static constructor.
 
Requirements
1. Class Design Constraints
• The class must be named ApplicationConfig
• No object creation is allowed for this class
• All members must be static
• Include a static constructor
 
2. Static Properties
Create the following static properties:
Property Name
Type
Description
ApplicationName
string
Stores application name
Environment
string
Stores environment name (Dev / QA / Prod)
AccessCount
int
Tracks number of method calls
IsInitialized
bool
Indicates whether config is initialized
 
3. Static Constructor
The static constructor must:
• Assign default values:
o ApplicationName = "MyApp"
o Environment = "Development"
o AccessCount = 0
o IsInitialized = false
• Display a console message:
• Static constructor executed
Note: The static constructor must execute only once, before the first static member access.
 
4. Static Methods
Implement the following static methods:
a) Initialize(string appName, string environment)
• Sets ApplicationName and Environment
• Sets IsInitialized = true
• Increments AccessCount
 
b) GetConfigurationSummary()
• Increments AccessCount
• Returns a formatted string containing:
o Application Name
o Environment
o Access Count
o Initialization Status
 
c) ResetConfiguration()
• Resets all values back to default
• Sets IsInitialized = false
• Increments AccessCount
 
5. Usage Instructions
In Main():
• Access at least one static property (to trigger static constructor)
• Call Initialize()
• Call GetConfigurationSummary()
• Call ResetConfiguration()
• Print returned outputs to console
 
Expected Learning Outcomes
By completing this assignment, the learner should be able to:
• Differentiate static vs instance members
• Understand static constructor execution timing
• Use static properties for shared state
• Implement utility-style classes
• Avoid improper object creation
